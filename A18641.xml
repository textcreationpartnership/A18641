         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:19486:84"/> and yet neuertheleſſe a man may finde at this day ſo many wicked and raſh people among the Chriſtians which are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to violate the edictes of the Prince, although that they are confirmable to all diuine and humaine ryght: Thincking thereby to hinder and let the courſe of the religion.</p>
               <p>Some myght héere replie, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame doth charge greatly thoſe of the reformed religion: Inaſmuch as they doe put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by weapons againſt the force &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their enimie.

For in vpholding and mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning the edyct of the king, they doe maintayne it in the authoritie &amp; puiſſance which the Lord hath giuen vnto him: And by the ſame meanes they, do kéepe his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes

And beſides they do giue an occaſion vnto the people to giue themſelues to all liſcenciouſneſſe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe. And conſequently he whiche doth violate the lawe of his prince doth ſinne many wayes.<note place="margin">Pro. <hi>8.</hi> e</note> Firſt of all he ſinneth againſt God: thorowe whome the kings reigne, and the princes make iuſt lawes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes beare rule, and all iudges of the earth execute iudgement.

Euen ſo is it of man: for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is verie eaſie: but the bringing vp of him is full of great trauaile and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Alſo we wil not counſaile thoſe which haue a certeine charge to inſtruct or teach the children, to conduct and guide them with force, feare, or with too greate bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. For as the ſame author witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,<note place="margin">plato li. 7. of his lawes</note> euen as too much laboure and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile is noiſome and hurtfull vnto the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, chiefly when it is taken by feare and compulſion: euen ſo no manner diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the ſoule forced and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is profitable. Wherefore he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that wée muſt nouriſh and bringe vp the children in learning, not as compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but as a playe and paſtime, to the ende that we may the eaſelier knowe the propertie of the ſpirites and mindes of the children. And to a verie good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hath the Poet <hi>Terence</hi> ſpoken,<note place="margin">Terencius in Adel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis.</note> which ſaide, that it is better to kéepe the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by ſhame and liberalitie then by feare. That is the cauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the time of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> the childe béeinge taken in any faulte
<pb facs="tcp:19486:187"/> was compelled to make certaine Towers ouer againſt the temple, and to pronounce and declare a prayer, the which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and written to his ſhame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure, which was none other thing but to blame himſelfe of his owne mouth: gée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs to vnderſtand by the ſame edict &amp; ſtatute, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children who of themſelues are cleane,<note place="margin">Plutarch in his apotheg</note> are ledde to honeſt thinges through ſhame and gentleneſſe, and that it is the propertie of ſeruauntes, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted and ledde by feare. Finally, this ſhall ſerue to the fathers, for to aduertiſe and warne them not to ſlacke ſo much the bridle to their children, that they doe not committe a thing which maye tourne to their ſhame and diſhonour, as it chaunced vnto <hi>Hely,</hi> as it appeareth in the firſt booke of <hi>Samuel:</hi> who for that he had borne too much with his children in their faultes,<note place="margin">1.
